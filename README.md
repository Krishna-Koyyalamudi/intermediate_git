* BRANCHES:

            - A Branch in github represents another copy of the master branch(made at that point of time).
            - A Branch is used to work with different versions of a repository at a same time.
            - By default a repository has a master branch otherwise called as production branch.
            - New branches are generally created for bug fixes and feature work seperate from the master branch.
            - When changes are ready, they can be merged into the master branch. If you make changes to the master branch while working on a      new branch, these updates can be pulled in.
